Statistical Analysis Answer to the last two points
•	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
According to the scattered plots, the data appears to be homogeneously distributed. In this case, we can have an excellent approximation of symmetric data. In this case, the means seem to provide a good data summary.
•	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
According to the values of the standard deviation, unsuccessfully campaigns tend to be closer to the mean of that set of data.
